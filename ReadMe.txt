**Student:** GALIZRA Fethi Imadeddine  
**Group:** G3 L3 Mathematics  
**Academic Year:** 2025–2026  

## Overview

Implementation of Newton method with line search, Quasi-Newton DFP, and Quasi-Newton BFGS methods for unconstrained optimization, as studied in the *Optimisation sans contrainte* course.
